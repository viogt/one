We're being judged by a new yard-stick: not just by how smart we are, or by our training and expertise, but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yard-stick is increasingly applied in choosing who will be hired and who will not, who will be let go and who retained, who passed over and who promoted.</p><p>
These rules have little to do with what we were told was important in school; <i>academic abilities are largely irrelevant to</i> this standard. The new measure takes for granted having enough intellectual ability and technical know-how to do our jobs; it focuses instead on personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness.</p><p>
This is no <i>passing fad</i>, nor just the management nostrum of the moment. The data that argue for taking it seriously are based on studies of tens of thousands of working people, in callings of every kind. And it demonstrates which human abilities make up the greater part of the ingredients for excellence at work -- most especially for leadership.</p><p>
If you are part of a management team, you need to consider whether your organization <i>fosters</i> these competencies or discourages them.</p><p>
An emotional competence is a learned capability based on emotional intelligence that results in <i>outstanding</i> performance at work.</p><p>
Competencies come in clusters. For top performance a person must master a mix of competencies, not just one or two.</p><p>
Only when they reach a critical mass from the full spectrum do they emerge as outstanding-something akin to a chemical reaction achieved the moment of catalysis.</p><p>
The conclusions of a <i>landmark study</i> of top executives who <i>derailed</i>, the two most <i>common traits</i> of those who failed.</p><p>
The single most frequently mentioned factor: being too <i>harshly</i> critical, insensitive or <i>demanding</i>, so that they alienated those they worked with.</p><p>
Trustworthiness: The failures typically were overly ambitious, too ready to get ahead at the expense of other people.</p><p>
Obvious: It isn't that they can't see the solution - they can't see the problem.</p><p>
Contemplation: People at this stage see that they need to improve and have begun to think about how to do so. Ambivalence is <i>rampant</i>: some wait for a "magic moment" of readiness. People at this stage are as likely to say they intend to take some action "next month" as they are to say they'll do it "in the next six months". It's not unusual for people "to spend" years telling them that someday they are going to change". They substitute thinking for acting.</p><p>
Preparation: Here people have begun to focus on the solution - on how to improve. They are aware of the problem, see that there are ways to solve it, and <i>palpably</i> anticipate doing so. This is the time for formulating a specific, detailed plan of action.</p><p>
Action: Visible change begins. People <i>embrace</i> the plan, start practicing its steps, and actually change how they act - their emotional patterns, the way they think about themselves, and all the other facets of transforming a <i>long-standing habit</i>.</p><p>
<i>Feedback lies at the heart</i> of change. Knowing how we are doing <i>keeps us on track</i>. In its most basic form, feedback means that someone notices whether -- or how well -- the new competence is being used and lets us know.</p><p>
Emotional competence cannot be improved overnight, because the motional brain changes its habits over weeks and months, not hours and days.</p><p>

	You <i>have a nerve</i> telling me what to do (be impudently aggressive, show effrontery). She had the <i>effrontery</i> to ask for two free samples.<BR/>
	A group of people who have been ridiculed, <i>ostracized</i>, and persecuted for centuries.<BR/>
	To my great embarassment, the proceedings are under way, waiting the system to depart the scene.<BR/>
</p>
<p>
	<i>Dissenting</i> opinion, no dissent from this view, <i>apart from</i> this point view...<BR/>
	As it may be construed (interpreted)...<BR/>
	It can be carried out voluntarily, or it will be implemented <i>forcibly</i>.<BR/>
	To <i>forfeit</i> human rights within the EU integration.<BR/>
	The courts <i>bent to the will</i> of the authorities.<BR/>
	Throw economists into a <i>despondent</i> mood (discouraged).<BR/>
	To <i>go rogue</i> is to cease to follow orders; to act on one's own, usually against expectation or instruction. To pursue one's own interests.<BR/>
	The situation gets <i>volatile</i>.<BR/>
	I have a <i>hunch</i> (intuition, premonition) about the way things will happen... with <i>judiciousness</i> require<BR/>
</p>
<p>
	In safe hands.<BR/>
	A tough nut to crack.<BR/>
	I don't want you to <i>chicken out</i> at the last minute.<BR/>
	To add fuel to the fire.<BR/>
	The big cheese.<BR/>
	<i>In a nutshell</i>, in brief.<BR/>
	They were always making <i>catty</i> (<i>spiteful</i>)comments about each other.<BR/>
	<i>Lame</i> system, <i>cunning</i> person, treacherous, insidious, sly, crafty.<BR/>
	<i>Untoward</i> and adverse. There was anything untoward going on. Nothing untoward occurred.<BR/>
	To provide the <i>veneer of</i> legality.<BR/>
	Legal <i>ruse</i> (dodge). Resort to a ruse or trickery.<BR/>
	Otherwise any attempts to <i>reshuffle</i> personnel within the system would have been impossible.<BR/>
</p>
<p>
	To <i>taint</i>, to corrupt, to infect with putrefaction or decay, flaw, a trace of evil, disgrace, corruption.<BR/>
	A reputation that was <i>tainted by allegations</i> of illegal activity.<BR/>
	Drinking water that is <i>tainted with</i> parasites; toothpaste that is tainted with toxic metals.<BR/>
	A <i>stain on</i> his reputation (spot of wrongdoing or of disgrace).<BR/>
	For the sake of time, if the laws/rules apply..., good question to start with...<BR/>
	Brief and glorious moment, incidentally, foremost.<BR/>
	But I do have my own guess about.. please bear in mind.<BR/>
</p>
<p>
	She opened the window just enough to <i>eavesdrop on</i> the conversation outside.<BR/>
	A display of unnecessary or excessive excitement, activity, or interest : I don't know what all the <i>fuss</i> is about.<BR/>
	The <i>subterfugea</i> is a criminal scheme or stratagem employed to defraud.<BR/>
	Jusrice <i>devoid of</i> independence.<BR/>
	Time presses. Stubbornly optimistic.<BR/>
	The resemblance isn't accidental/<BR/>
	I have to reprobate this ab initio.<BR/>
	Insofar as the law permits.<BR/>
	I'm still fuzzy on it.<BR/>
	The court <i>flouted</i> the rules... openely disregarded.<BR/>
	<i>Lex loci damni</i> refers to the law of the place where the injury occurs. In other words, if an injury appears in another country, the laws of that 	country govern.<BR/>
</p>
<p>
	To <i>pile</i> pressure over...<BR/>
	There is <i>no margin</i> for errors.<BR/>
	This is <i>beyond my grasp</i>.<BR/>
	Turn the tide, slaw the pace, mount the case.<BR/>
	Give a <i>cursory</i> (not thorough) glance at the wording….<BR/>
	Room for manoeuvre, boiling point.<BR/>
	There is something eluding you.<BR/>
	The solution lies in the treatment.<BR/>
