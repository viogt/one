We're being judged by a new yard-stick: not just by how smart we are, or by our training and expertise, but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yard-stick is increasingly applied in choosing who will be hired and who will not, who will be let go and who retained, who passed over and who promoted.</p><p>
These rules have little to do with what we were told was important in school; <i>academic abilities are largely irrelevant to</i> this standard. The new measure takes for granted having enough intellectual ability and technical know-how to do our jobs; it focuses instead on personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness.</p><p>
This is no <i>passing fad</i>, nor just the management nostrum of the moment. The data that argue for taking it seriously are based on studies of tens of thousands of working people, in callings of every kind. And it demonstrates which human abilities make up the greater part of the ingredients for excellence at work -- most especially for leadership.</p><p>
If you are part of a management team, you need to consider whether your organisation <i>fosters</i> these competencies or discourages them.<br><span style="font-size: 14pt;">An emotional competence is a learned capability based on emotional intelligence that results in </span><i style="font-size: 14pt;">outstanding</i><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> performance at work.<br></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Competencies come in clusters. For top performance a person must master a mix of competencies, not just one or two.<br></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Only when they reach a critical mass from the full spectrum do they emerge as outstanding-something akin to a chemical reaction achieved the moment of catalysis.</span></p><p>

Ambivalence is </span><i style="font-size: 14pt;">rampant</i><span style="font-size: 14pt;">: some wait for a "magic moment" of readiness. People at this stage are as likely to say they intend to take some action "next month" as they are to say they'll do it "in the next six months". It's not unusual for people "to spend" years telling them that someday they are going to change". They substitute thinking for acting.<br></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Preparation: Here people have begun to focus on the solution - on how to improve. They are aware of the problem, see that there are ways to solve it, and </span><i style="font-size: 14pt;">palpably</i><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> anticipate doing so. This is the time for formulating a specific, detailed plan of action.<br></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Action: Visible change begins. People </span><i style="font-size: 14pt;">embrace</i><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> the plan, start practicing its steps, and actually change how they act - their emotional patterns, the way they think about themselves, and all the other facets of transforming a </span><i style="font-size: 14pt;">long-standing habit</i><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.</span></p><p>
<i>Feedback lies at the heart</i> of change. Knowing how we are doing <i>keeps us on track</i>. In its most basic form, feedback means that someone notices whether -- or how well -- the new competence is being used and lets us know.<br><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Emotional competence cannot be improved overnight, because the motional brain changes its habits over weeks and months, not hours and days.<br></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The children love </span><i style="font-size: 14pt;">roaming about</i><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in the fields and woods.<br></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Somebody remains </span><i style="font-size: 14pt;">committed to</i><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> the principles of...</span></p>

	I give you a big <i>hug</i>&nbsp;(cuddly). You <i>tease</i> me? He's <i>cherry-picking</i> the facts.<br>
	To <i>gear up for</i>... (prepare for). <i>Lavish</i> hospitality (generous, wasteful). A <i>relentless</i> (unyielding) enemy.<br>
	Twist of the story. <i>Bending</i> the laws of physics for dramatic effects. To steer to the right path, or stray from the path.<br>To <i>circumvent</i> the real issues.<br><i>Cringe</i>, draw back, as with fear or pain, show submission or fear.<br><i>Gullible</i> - easily deceived or cheated, naive, credulous.<br>
	Due to the <i>scarcity</i> or reliability of sources... The most natural <i>epithets</i> of...<br>

	They were accused of <i>slandering</i> the head of state (defamation).<br>
	To <i>sue</i> somebody for breach of contract...to institute legal proceedings against a person or institution, typically for redress.<br>
	I can't <i>take credit for</i> this success.<br>

<p>
	<i>Call on</i> the Commission to comply... I <i>take your point</i>... in the <i>quest of understanding</i> and get my meal.<br>
	A <i>riddle still remains</i>. <i>Shows fatigue</i>. <i>Wanton and unrestrained cruelty</i>.<br>
	Arms race. To <i>trace it back</i> and figure out where it comes from. Get near to it.<br>This has <i>undergone</i> many changes.<br>

<p>
	Afford just satisfaction to the injured party. A <i>slick</i> (smooth, clever) plan. <i>Avenues</i> to greater power.<br>
	Before the <i>domestic avenues were exhausted</i>. To exhaust (run through) avenues to achieve that.<br>
	<i>On the verge of</i> a crisis. To <i>break away from</i> this territory.<br>
	How anyone <i>by any stretch of the imagination</i> could fail to understand. At a stretch - continuously.<br>
	<i>Stretch the truth</i>, to exaggerate.

	<i>Above all</i>&nbsp;(else), patience rewarded. <i>Malleable</i>. He faces the abyss. Hard palpitations.<br><i>Nail</i> it.
	<i>As we speak</i>... Make the vision flesh.
	Your contract <i>sets out</i> the terms and conditions of your employment.<br>
	Then the plans <i>go sour</i>. To <i>deride</i>/ridicule the others.<br>

	<i>For the clarity/simplicity sake</i>... Idea <i>difficult to grasp</i>, not <i>intelligible</i>.<br>
	Patriotism <i>swells</i> across German lands.

	But more importantly, ...<br>
	It <i>harbours</i> life, to harbour (shelter) a criminal.<br>
	In so doing, ...<br>
	He <i>hosted</i> the foreign <i>dignitaries</i> (VIP, pillar of society) during their visit.<br>
	Enter unchartered waters.
	<i>Rip</i> something from something, tear apart. <i>Teemed with</i> novel ideas.<br>
	To <i>fence</i> them off (in, out) the from the outer world. To fence a farm. The president was <i>fenced by</i> his bodyguards.<br>
	He <i>fenced</i> when he was asked if he would... (dodge, hedge,evasive). To <i>scramble</i> through obstacles.<br>
</p>
<p>
	He proposed to <i>impugn</i> the whole train of legal proceedings.<br>
	<i>Stand aside</i> and watching... <i>pour fuel in</i> the fire.<br>

	High resolution <i>surveillance</i>. To <i>outfit</i> an expedition, to equip. A <i>snapshot</i>!<br>

	Put it <i>mildly</i>. Last but not least,... miss the point<br>
<i>First off</i>,... <i>provided that</i> (on condition that)...<br>
<i>Supposing</i> I do it, what would the countermeasures be.<br>
A rough guess. Reach an impasse.<br>
<i>Run out of</i> patience, run late, run short.<br>
Step on the gas!<br>
<i>To top it all</i>. Take a hint. Not worth the candle.<br>
<i>Wishful</i> thinking. A bone of contention.<br>

<p>
	The plan begins to <i>crumble</i>.<br>
	He has yet to <i>make a case for</i> change. But he could <i>make his point</i>.<br>
	To <i>attain</i> decent accuracy. <i>Unattainable goal</i>. To attain to understanding/knowledge.<br>
	Lawsuit and its <i>mistrial</i> (defence request a mistrial to be declared). Request for admission, or application or <i>motion</i> for a court order.<br>
	<i>Overrule</i> (revoke, annul). <i>Statute/period of limitation</i>.<br>
	To <i>recuse</i> (challenge, disqualify) the judge or himself.<br>
	The court orders <i>remand</i> of these cases (send the case from appeal to the lower court).<br>

<p>
	<i>Sneak preview</i> - film preview before the official release.<br>
	Snap decision (quick, without thinking about consequences).<br>
	Otherwise, I will proceed <i>on the above basis</i>.<br>
	Unbeknownst to many, <i>unbeknown to</i> me until it had happened.<br>
	To <i>lure</i> the customers, lure you to Hell, lure the cat out.<br>
	I had to <i>concede</i> that I'd overreacted (admit as true after denying).<br>
	<i>Heading toward</i> the parking. I'm on my way. En route to...<br>
	The onward <i>surge</i> of an angry mob.<br>
	<i>Reconnaissance</i>. Wipe the tears.<br>
	<i>Scrambled for</i> the best seats.<br>
	It is <i>tedious, boring, tiresome and muddy</i>. He is moulder (turnator)<br>
	By evening the rain <i>relented</i> (become less severe or intense, mitigate, abandon).<br>
	<i>Unpalatable</i> truth (unpleasant, difficult to tolerate or accept).<br>
	A public <i>backlash</i> against a current social or political development (strong and adverse reaction by a large number of people).<br>

</p>
<p>
	The second feeling was a fear of <i>pursuit</i>. Pursuit of fugitives.<br>
	I am <i>enthralled with</i> the idea of having... <i>Enthral by</i> the beauty of... Excited...<br>
	I am <i>enthusiastic about</i>...<i>Thrilled at</i> the prospect of... thrilled to announce... <i>Enchanted of</i>...<br>
	You're a <i>disgrace</i> (pozor) to the profession. Really <i>gratifying</i> to me.<br>
	A <i>benchmark</i> (etalon).<br>
	Rock the boat, <i>corrosive</i> to the system.<br>
	<psan>Pernicious</psan> (destructive, detrimental) effect.<br>
	<i>Beware of</i> using... now <i>my case rests</i>.<br>
	He goes on to say...<br>
	We had a <i>queer</i> feeling that they were being watched. A <i>queer</i> notion of justice (questionable, suspicious).<br>
	Reg didn't want someone meddling and <i>queering</i> (spoil or ruin) the deal at the last minute.<br>
</p>
<p>
	I hope you don't either... in your humorous way.<br>
	You better not believe that. Absence of coherence.<br>
	Would you like me to (re-)draft (compose) the document/sketch?<br>
	We slid from... to...<br>
	If you chase two rabbits, you will lose them both.<br>
	If you run after two hares, you will catch neither.<br>
	...in tight schedule, on short notice.<br>
	High-profile: <i>conspicuous</i>, attracting attention, as by being unusual or remarkable, noticeable.<br>
	<i>Giggle</i> is laugh in a silly way.<br>
	Put the plan in practice.<br>
	Complaints and <i>grievances</i>.<br>
	Who <i>kindled</i> that fire in us?<br>
	Life-threatening, primordially.<br>
	Strenuous way, requiring much effort, not least in the interest of the community.<br>
</p>
<p>
	He <i>concedes</i> to us what we wanted ...then conceded with a <i>shrug</i>.
	Walk at different <i>paces</i>. It was more a <i>nuisance</i>/annoyance then pleasure<br>
	What do you hint at?<br>
	<i>Magic wand</i> and crystal ball<br>
	A <i>clear-cut</i> objective, sharply defined; easy to perceive.<br>
	As far as I know/<i>to my knowledge</i>.<br>
	Updates are constantly <i>fed</i> (operated) to...<br>
	<i>Mark my words, ...</i><br>
	Needless to say, I <i>blushed</i> when he did it. It makes me blush...<br>
	Empirical support for... I'm <i>abashed</i>/confused/perplexed by this... I won't be around to see it.<br>
	He <i>tramples on</i> the roses.<br>
</p>
<p>
	Separate the <i>wheat from the chaff</i>, i.e. to separate what is useful or valuable from what is worthless.<br>
	<i>Not that</i> I mind, but why didn't you phone yesterday?<br>
	My body is <i>numb</i>.<br>
	The statistics you quoted didn't prove anything, they simply <i>muddied the waters</i>.<br>
	There is nothing I <i>relish</i> more than...<br>
	You <i>cut into</i> my time. It cuts into my weekend.<br>
</p>
<p>
	The issue brought to the <i>forefront</i>, values you <i>espouse</i> (embrace, advocate).<br>
	To <i>elevate</i> the public discourse.<br>
	People <i>flock</i> around us and <i>yell</i>.<br>
	<i>Pervasive</i> illusion (<i>ubiquitously</i> penetrating) is often a silly and <i>dump</i> question.<br>
	What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Christopher Hitchens<br>
	I <i>resent</i> the fact that... (express indignation).<br>
</p>
<p>
	In Europe we should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries <i>bully</i> smaller countries.<br>
	A <i>proselyte</i>. To proselytise is to covert.<br>
	<i>Rogue</i> cop scandal (dishonest).<br>
	Acting in defiance of established laws, customs, etc.: a <i>rogue</i> group.<br>
	I'm tempted to say... I tend to agree with... The reason I'm hostile to... Given the fact that...<br>
	This is because you did not <i>heed</i> (pay careful attention to) my advice. He paid little heed to the raised questions.<br>
	There is a growing trend that... an inflow of information.<br>
	Staring at the ceiling.<br>
	You <i>have a nerve</i> telling me what to do (be impudently aggressive, show effrontery). She had the <i>effrontery</i> to ask for two free samples.<br>
	A group of people who have been ridiculed, <i>ostracised</i>, and persecuted for centuries.<br>
	To my great embarrassment, the proceedings are under way, waiting the system to depart the scene.<br>
</p>
<p>
	<i>Dissenting</i> opinion, no dissent from this view, <i>apart from</i> this point view...<br>
	As it may be construed (interpreted)...<br>
	It can be carried out voluntarily, or it will be implemented <i>forcibly</i>.<br>
	To <i>forfeit</i> human rights within the EU integration.<br>
	The courts <i>bent to the will</i> of the authorities.<br>
	Throw economists into a <i>despondent</i> mood (discouraged).<br>
	To <i>go rogue</i> is to cease to follow orders; to act on one's own, usually against expectation or instruction. To pursue one's own interests.<br>
	The situation gets <i>volatile</i>.<br>
	I have a <i>hunch</i> (intuition, premonition) about the way things will happen... with <i>judiciousness</i> require<br>

	In safe hands.<br>
	A tough nut to crack.<br>
	I don't want you to <i>chicken out</i> at the last minute.<br>
	To add fuel to the fire.<br>
	The big cheese.<br>
	<i>In a nutshell</i>, in brief.<br>
	They were always making <i>catty</i> (<i>spiteful</i>) comments about each other.<br>
	<i>Lame</i> system (cripple), <i>cunning</i>&nbsp;(sly,&nbsp;treacherous, callous, vile, cruel<span style="font-size: 14pt;">) person, insidious, sly, crafty.<br>To <i>cripple</i> is make someone unable to move, to <i>paralyse</i>, <i>mesmerise</i>, <i>transfix</i>.</span></p><p>
	<i>Untoward</i> and adverse. There was anything untoward going on. Nothing untoward occurred.<br>
	To provide the <i>veneer of</i> legality.<br>
	Legal <i>ruse</i> (dodge). Resort to a ruse or trickery.<br>
	Otherwise any attempts to <i>reshuffle</i> personnel within the system would have been impossible.<br>
</p>
<p>
	To <i>taint</i>, to corrupt, to infect with putrefaction or decay, flaw, a trace of evil, disgrace, corruption.<br>
	A reputation that was <i>tainted by allegations</i> of illegal activity.<br>
	Drinking water that is <i>tainted with</i> parasites; toothpaste that is tainted with toxic metals.<br>
	A <i>stain on</i> his reputation (spot of wrongdoing or of disgrace).<br>
	For the sake of time, if the laws/rules apply..., good question to start with...<br>
	Brief and glorious moment, incidentally, foremost.<br>
	But I do have my own guess about.. please bear in mind.<br>
</p>
<p>
	She opened the window just enough to <i>eavesdrop on</i> the conversation outside.<br>
	A display of unnecessary or excessive excitement, activity, or interest : I don't know what all the <i>fuss</i> is about.<br>
	The <i>subterfuge</i>&nbsp;is a criminal scheme or stratagem employed to defraud.<br>
	Justice <i>devoid of</i> independence.<br>
	Time presses. Stubbornly optimistic.<br>
	The resemblance isn't accidental/<br>
	I have to reprobate this ab initio.<br>
	Insofar as the law permits.<br>
	I'm still fuzzy on it.<br>
	The court <i>flouted</i> the rules... openly disregarded.<br>
	<i>Lex loci damni</i> refers to the law of the place where the injury occurs.<br>In other words, if an injury appears in another country, the laws of that 	country govern.<br>

<p>
	To <i>pile</i> pressure over...<br>
	There is <i>no margin</i> for errors.<br>
	This is <i>beyond my grasp</i>.<br>
	Turn the tide, slaw the <i>pace</i>, <i>stride</i> (walk with long steps), mount the case.<br>
	Give a <i>cursory</i> (not thorough) glance at the wording….<br>
	Room for manoeuvre, boiling point.<br>
	There is something eluding you.<br>
